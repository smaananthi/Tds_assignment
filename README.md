# Tds_assignment
The Python code(app.py) is a concise Streamlit application that finds the largest number among three input numbers provided by the user. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Imports**: 
   - It imports the Streamlit library and gives it an alias `st`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - It defines a function `find_largest(num1, num2, num3)` to find the largest number among three input numbers.

3. **Main Function**:
   - It defines the main function of the program where the Streamlit application is set up.

4. **User Input**:
   - It prompts the user to input three numbers.

5. **Button Interaction**:
   - It creates a button labeled "Find Largest" for the user to click.

6. **Finding the Largest Number**:
   - It calls the `find_largest` function to compute the largest number among the inputs.

7. **Execution**:
   - It ensures that the main function is executed when the script is run directly.

In summary, this code creates a simple Streamlit app to find the largest number among three user-provided inputs, with concise implementation and straightforward functionality.
